### The Importance of Coral Reefs

In order to keep the world’s oceans healthy and functioning, healthy coral reef ecosystems are essential. Typically when one pictures a coral reef, a colourful array of stony (Scleractinian) corals comes to mind. These reefs are formed by colonies of microscopic coral individuals, called polyps, that form a characteristic hard skeleton to protect themselves (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). The bright colours associated with coral reefs are due to microscopic organisms, dinoflagellates, that live protected inside the coral skeleton, providing nutrients to the coral and allowing it to grow (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). Coral reefs are vital to humans; they provide humanity with food security, economic livelihood, and protection from coastal erosion (Eddy et al., 2021). As the current state of climate change and global emissions predict that most warm-water coral reefs will be pushed to extinction over the next 30 years, due to rising ocean temperatures and acidity, current action combatting global warming is necessary (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). 

### Reef Paleoclimatology

Certain long-term responses of past coral reefs to climate change reemerge frequently and can serve as an indicator of future events. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum was a high temperature event that lasted through the first two epochs of the Palaeogene period, approximately 65 million years ago, and was associated with a massive carbon release to the atmosphere (McInerney and Wing, 2011; Westerhold et al., 2008). Changing oceanic conditions led to the diverse evolution of specific marine molluscs that could build small reef structures, which improved survival (Kauffman and Johnson., 1988). Fossil records suggest that migration, adaptation, and extinction were the responses of coral reefs to climatic stressors (Pandolfi and Kiessling, 2014). Living coral reefs expanded their geological ranges, migrating to cooler waters with reduced acidification. Coral reefs also developed relationships with algal symbionts, to appropriately suit environmental conditions (Webster and Reusch, 2017). Calcified marine animals with more basic exoskeletons were more resistant to increased CO<sub>2</sub>, as the alkaline structures counteracted the increasingly acidic ocean (Taylor et al., 2015).

### Today's Coral Reefs

Coral reefs have been among the most susceptible ecosystems to the Earth’s rapidly changing climate. Increasing ocean temperatures, and acidity have adversely affected coral health, resulting in a decrease of warm-water reef coverage by over 50% in the past 70 years (Eddy et al., 2021). Increased water temperatures decrease the resilience of coral reefs, and their overall population, due to expulsion of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (Mumby and van Woesik, 2014). This is referred to as coral bleaching, the greatest present threat to global coral populations (Souter et al., 2020) (Figure 1).

The negative effects on coral reef organisms then go on to impact entire ecosystems, with changing climatic conditions altering the overall community structure of reef environments (Araújo-Silva, Sarmento and Santos, 2022). This make its increasingly difficult for reef ecosystems to respond to future disturbances, and recover from the negative impacts of climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). 

### Emergent Technologies and Future Reef Research

Evolution, relocation, and acclimatization are the three main suggested ways for coral reefs to cope with the changing temperature and pH of the ocean, and various methodologies are emerging to support corals in those ways (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). Although there has been evidence to show corals can remember and react accordingly to past stress, this ability could use further research to develop ways to utilise it effectively (Hackerott, Martell and Eirin-Lopez, 2021). Recently, cryopreserved sperm of one Acropora palmata coral population was used to fertilize a different coral population, which resulted in promising offspring survival (Hagedorn et al., 2021). Last but not least, CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing technology, was used with single-guide RNA to induce mutations in different Acropora millepora genes with encouraging success (Cleves et al., 2018).
